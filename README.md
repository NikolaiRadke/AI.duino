# 🤖 AI.duino - AI assistant for Arduino IDE 2.X

AI.duino integrates the API providers **Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral, Perplexity and Cohere, Croq**, aggregator services **OpenRouter and Hugging Face**, and local providers **Claude Code, Codex CLI, LM Studio and Ollama** directly into the Arduino IDE for intelligent code assistance. It also works with **VS Code**. Please use the newest Version to avoid annoying bugs.  

> [!NOTE]
> Groq ist not Grok! AI.duino is Elon-free! 

*Oje, Englisch? Kann ich nicht. Schnell [hier hin](https://github.com/NikolaiRadke/AI.duino/wiki)*.  

🆕 What's new?  
* **20.01.2026** Working heavy on agentic coding integration.

## Features

### Supported Languages
The plugin uses the language selected in your IDE preferences. If it's a non-IDE language, select in in the plugin menu. Supported are:   
**bg, bs, cs, da, de, el, en, es, et, fi, fr, hr, hu, is, it, ja, ko, lt, lv, mk, mt, nl, no, pl, pt, ro, sk, sl, sq, sr, sv, tr, uk, zh**.   
No, i don't speak all these languages, the locales were generated by Claude Opus 4.1. You can add your own 
language bei adding a **xx.json** file to your ```locales/``` folder

### Code Optimization
Optimizes Code. Example: Converts blocking code into non-blocking variants, `delay()` is replaced with `millis()`-based implementations.

### Code Explanation
Explains complex Arduino commands and hardware registers in plain language.

### Automatic Documentation
Adds meaningful comments to existing code.

### Error Analysis
Explains compiler error messages and provides concrete solutions.
When using this feature, you copy the error message from the Arduino output window.

### Direct AI Question with Follow up Questions
Ask something with or without marked code. You can ask further context-related.

### Debug Support
- Analysis of Serial Monitor output
- Hardware diagnostics for common problems
- Timing analysis

### AI Chat 
Multiple chats like in the browser but integrated in the IDE with history based persistance. Claude Code provides full session persistance.
You can add files content. All feature results can be discussed here too.  

### Custom Agents
Let the AI do some tasks for you, like error checking after compiling. Agents can include build outputs and additional 
internal and external files .

### Offline Code Analysis 
Gives some information about the current file.

### Inline Completion
AI will suggest code completion behind common keywords like ``` Serial. ``` and in comments ending with ':'.   
Example: ``` // Let the LED blink for three times: ```. Press *<Tab>* to accept the suggestion. 
You can select a different provider, **Groq** is fast, free and recommended for inline completion.

### Auto Update
The provider settings will be updated when availabe. They will be generated automatically every week. The extension is checking itself 
and will inform the user for new version updates.

## Usage

1. Select code in Arduino IDE
2. Right-click → `AI.duino` → Choose function in the menu above
* `Ctrl+Shift+C` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+C` (Mac)
* Press the `AI.duino` button below  
* Enter Ai.duino menu through the side tree bar

## Installation

### Automatic (recommended)

You need the VSIX file *aiduino.vsix* in the same folder with the installer. The installer will install the plugin in your home folder. 
If you want to install it into the Arduino programm directory, see *Manual installation*. 
  
#### Windows
Run ``` install_arduinoplus_windows.bat ``` as administrator

#### Linux
```
chmod +x install_aiduino_linux.sh
./install_aiduino_install_linux.sh
```

#### macOS
```
chmod +x install_aiduino_macos.sh
./install_aiduino_Install_macos.sh
```

## Manual Installation

Add read permissions to each folder and file. Copy the prepared `aiduino` folder to the Arduino IDE plugin directory. 
The folder must have the following structure:
```
aiduino/
└── extension/
    ├── icons/ 
    ├── locales/
    └── out/
        ├── config/
        ├── core/
        ├── features/
        |   ├── inlineCompletion/
        ├── localProviders/
        |   ├── httpProviders/
        |   └── processProviders/
        └── utils/
            └── panels/
```

#### Windows
```
C:\Program Files\Arduino IDE\resources\app\plugins\
```

#### macOS (Untested)
```
/Applications/Arduino IDE.app/Contents/Resources/app/plugins/
```

#### Linux
``` /usr/share/arduino/resources/app/plugins/ ```   
or   
``` ~/.local/share/arduino-ide/resources/app/plugins/ ```   

## Deinstallation

You can completly remove the extension in the AI.duino settings panel bei clickung the uninstall button.  Are you sure? 
Are you really REALLY sure?   

If you installed AI.duino manually into the plugin folder, you need to remove it by yourself. AI.duino has no permissions
to do that.  

## API Keys

AI.duino communicates through the API with the AIs. It's impossible to  connect through the web 
interface, so an API key is **mandatory**. If you already have a monthly paid account, you need 
to - *sigh* - buy an additional key for about **$5**. Fortunatly, this really lasts long.
  
> [!TIP]
> You can try **Groq** and **Gemini**: They have a rate for API keys for **free**.  
  
Required: An API key from either:
- Claude: https://console.anthropic.com 
- ChatGPT: https://platform.openai.com
- Gemini: https://makersuite.google.com
- Mistral: https://console.mistral.ai
- Perplexity: https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api (Untested)
- Cohere: https://dashboard.cohere.ai (Untested)
- Croq: https://console.groq.com
- OpenRouter: https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys (>= V2.5.0)
- Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens (Untested, >= V2.5.0)
- Fireworks: https://app.fireworks.ai/login?redirectURI=%2Fsettings%2Fusers%2Fapi-keys (Untested, >= V2.5.0)
- Together: https://api.together.xyz/sso-signin?redirectUrl=%2Fsettings%2Fapi-keys (Untested, >= V2.5.0)
  

The keys are stored locally and not transmitted.

**Local providers** don't need an API key. If you have an account, for example *Pro Plan* with Claude, you can use Claude Cor no extra costs. 
HTTP based providers like **Ollama** get auto detected, process based providers like **Claude Code** only needs the path to the binary. 
Example: Try *which claude* (Linux/macOS) or *where claude* (Windows) and copy the path for the AI.duino 
input field when selecting Claude Code.  

Supported Providers:
- Claude Code (Claude Plan Pro): https://www.claude.com/pricing
- Codex CLI (ChatGPT Plus): https://chatgpt.com/#pricing (Untested)
- Ollama: https://ollama.com/
- LM Studio: https://lmstudio.ai
