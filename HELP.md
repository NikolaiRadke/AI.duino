# FAQ

### "Groq? Really? AI.duino ist supporting Elon??"
➡️ **No.** **Groq** (with an **q** is an independent AI infrastructure company founded by former Google engineers. It has no connection to Elon Musk or X/Twitter. **Grok** (with a "k") is xAI's chatbot. AI.duino uses **Groq** for its fast API access to open-source models - a purely technical choice based on performance.

    
### "The browser chats have microfone input. Does AI.duino has it?"
➡️ **No.** Sorry. the IDE itself has no given permissions to access the microphone for security reasons. Use your OS voice input:
* Windows: Press WIN + H 
* macOS: Press Fn two times
* Linux: Use *IBus Typing Booster* with *Voice Input* or install *Nerd Dictation*. 

    
### "Where is the rigth-click context menu from the IDE in the output window?"
➡️ The IDE disabled right-click for security reasons. Because Copy&Paste is important, AI.duino uses a tricky own workaround menu.
